    <h1>How Borderlands 1 weapon stats and parts work</h1>

    <p>
      In Borderlands 1, weapon stats are not fixed values. Damage, accuracy, fire rate,
      reload speed, and magazine size can all vary between weapons with the same name.
      These differences come from how each weapon is generated from a combination of
      parts and stat ranges.
    </p>

    <p>
      Understanding how weapon parts influence stats helps explain why some drops feel
      weak while others perform far better, even when they appear identical at first
      glance.
    </p>

    <h2>Why weapons with the same name have different stats</h2>

    <p>
      Most Borderlands 1 weapons are assembled from multiple interchangeable parts.
      Each part applies bonuses or penalties to specific stats, resulting in a final
      roll that falls somewhere within the weapon’s possible stat ranges.
    </p>

    <p>
      Two weapons with the same name, level, and rarity can therefore end up with
      noticeably different performance depending on their parts.
    </p>

    <h2>Which weapon stats can vary</h2>

    <p>
      Not every stat is fixed. Many weapons roll values within defined minimum and
      maximum ranges.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Damage</li>
      <li>Accuracy</li>
      <li>Fire rate</li>
      <li>Magazine size</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A higher roll within these ranges generally results in better performance,
      though trade-offs between stats are common.
    </p>

    <h2>Common weapon part categories</h2>

    <p>
      Weapons are built from several part categories. Not every weapon uses every
      category, but most follow a similar structure.
    </p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Part type</th>
          <th>Commonly affected stats</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Barrel</td>
          <td>Damage, accuracy, fire rate</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Body</td>
          <td>Base stat scaling and behaviour</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Magazine</td>
          <td>Magazine size, reload speed</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Stock</td>
          <td>Recoil and accuracy stability</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Sight</td>
          <td>Zoom level and handling</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Accessory</td>
          <td>Conditional bonuses or special effects</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      Each part contributes its own modifiers, and the final weapon stats are the
      result of all these effects combined.
    </p>

    <h2>Manufacturer influence</h2>

    <p>
      Weapon manufacturers in Borderlands 1 are not cosmetic. Each manufacturer
      tends to bias weapons toward certain strengths and weaknesses.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, some manufacturers favour higher fire rates, while others prioritise
      raw damage or accuracy. These tendencies influence which parts are available and
      how stats are weighted.
    </p>

    <h2>What players mean by a “perfect roll”</h2>

    <p>
      A perfect roll refers to a weapon that lands near the top of its possible stat
      ranges while avoiding major penalties from its parts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Perfection is contextual. A high-damage roll may come with lower accuracy, and
      a faster fire rate may reduce control. The best roll depends on playstyle and
      build rather than a single number.
    </p>

    <h2>Why understanding parts matters when farming</h2>

    <p>
      Knowing that weapons are assembled from parts explains why repeated farming is
      often necessary. The same weapon can drop many times before appearing with a
      strong combination of stats.
    </p>

    <p>
      Players who understand which stats matter most for their build can more quickly
      recognise good rolls and ignore weaker ones.
    </p>

    <h2>Making weapon stats visible</h2>

    <p>
      Borderlens aims to make these hidden differences clear by showing full stat
      ranges, part breakdowns, and known drop locations for Borderlands 1 weapons.
      This allows players to evaluate rolls without guesswork.
