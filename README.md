# Borderlens

Borderlens is a weapon database and reference site for the Borderlands series, built to make sense of how weapons actually work. It focuses on clear, accurate data around weapon stats, part combinations, and legendary behaviour, without the noise.

The site currently centres on Borderlands 1, providing full weapon breakdowns, stat ranges driven by parts, and reliable drop source information. Whether you are planning a build, farming a specific legendary, or trying to understand why a weapon rolled the way it did, Borderlens aims to give you answers quickly.

To support that, Borderlens includes a Claptrap-powered AI assistant that helps you explore the data more easily. It can look up weapons, compare stats, explain part effects, and help reason about perfect rolls, all without breaking your flow.
