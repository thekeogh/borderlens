  "description": "Massacre is a long-range support machine gun title built around high accuracy and strong recoil reduction, making it effective for sustained fire at distance and mixed critical/body hits. The title is lower priority than Havoc, so it cannot reach the very highest fire-rate rolls.",
  "notes": "Torgue and Vladof cannot manufacture Massacres because their best Support Machine Guns top out around 88.3 and 88.5 accuracy. The Massacre title (Accuracy1_Massacre) is awarded to high-accuracy Support Machine Guns and further improves recoil reduction.",
