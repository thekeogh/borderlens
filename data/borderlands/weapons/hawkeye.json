  "description": "Hawkeye is a pump-action sniper rifle title that guarantees extremely high accuracy (98%+), making it one of the most accurate and rare weapons in the game. Hawkeyes always roll the most accurate barrel and slightly increased scope zoom; only Atlas, Jakobs, and Maliwan can produce them.",
  "notes": "Vladof cannot manufacture Hawkeyes because their material grades add spread. The Hawkeye title (Title_Accuracy1_Hawkeye) requires accuracy of at least 98.7, trims spread by about 10%, and slightly boosts zoom; very few part combinations qualify, which is why Hawkeyes are so uncommon.",
