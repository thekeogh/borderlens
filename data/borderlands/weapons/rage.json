  "description": "Rage machine pistols are burst-fire sidearms with very high fire rates. Their accuracy ranges from average to very high, and recoil is significant, so they are best used at close to mid range or for fast critical bursts on controlled rolls.",
  "notes": "Rage is a nameplate ( Title_Firerate1_Rage ) given to machine pistols that spawn with the Rage accessory ( acc2_Rage ). The accessory itself only gives a slight tech boost (which by itself is useless as being an accessory, it prevents the weapon from being elemental); the burst fire and fire rate boost are granted by the title in its place. This means that while it's possible to find the Rage accessory on a legendary machine pistol (except the Reaper ), it is impossible to obtain a legendary machine Pistol with the Rage effect.",
