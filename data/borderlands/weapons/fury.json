  "description": "Fury machine pistols trade accuracy for extremely high fire rate. Heavy recoil makes them best in short bursts at mid range or spray-and-pray up close, and they chew through ammo quickly, so ammo regeneration helps. Many players use them to rapidly apply elemental damage before swapping weapons.",
