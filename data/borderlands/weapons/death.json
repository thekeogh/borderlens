  "description": "Death shotguns are defined by high accuracy (at least 67%), letting them perform at medium and even long range. At close range they grant a 15% critical damage bonus on headshots, while at longer distances they behave like a classic shotgun by keeping the target inside the reticle.",
  "notes": "The critical bonus does not apply to melee critical hits, so a Spiked Death is no better in melee than other Spiked shotguns. The Death title (Title_Spread_Death) is granted to high-accuracy shotguns (67% or more); see stat modifiers for how the title changes the weapon.",
