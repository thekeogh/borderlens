  "description": "Pounders are combat rifles with middling accuracy, low fire rate, and frequent reloads, which makes them unpopular as general-purpose weapons. Their per-shot damage is high for a rifle and they always have a scope, and their lower fire rate can help elemental effects proc more often.",
  "notes": "The Pounder effect comes from the mag1a_pounder magazine. Non-unique and non-legendary versions also gain the Pounder title (Title_Mag1_Pounder), which adds roughly 10% damage. See stat modifiers for details.",
