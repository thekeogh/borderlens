  "type": "Sniper",
  "description": "Gamble is a pump-action sniper rifle title that boosts critical damage (about +50%) and tech at the cost of lower accuracy. The title further amplifies inaccuracy, and its rifles are not affected by external accuracy bonuses.",
  "notes": "The name reflects the playstyle, with high damage but unreliable precision, so critical hits are less consistent even when aiming carefully. The Gamble title (Title_LowAccuracy1_Gamble) is granted to sniper rifles with accuracy below about 94.7 and further increases inaccuracy while boosting critical damage and tech; see stat modifiers for details.",
