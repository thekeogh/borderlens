  "type": "SMG",
  "notes": "After killing Dr. Ned (the first time), he will drop a version of the Bruiser called the RF440 Relentless Bruiser. It is an SMG with the twisted barrel, giving it bullets that travel in a spiral trajectory and ricochet off of solid surfaces. It comes with a 55 round magazine and a distinct green and red color scheme.\nThe Bruiser effect comes from the Title_Damage1_Bruiser title. It is given to Submachine Guns that already have high damage, and further increases that damage by 15%. Note that the Stinger title has higher priority. Please see stat modifiers for an explanation on how to interpret all of these modifiers.",
