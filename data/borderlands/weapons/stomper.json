  "type": "Assault Rifle",
  "description": "Stompers are high-damage shotguns with solid accuracy but slow projectile velocity, making them most effective up close. They excel in cover-heavy fights where you can dump a full magazine into a single target, then reload safely.",
  "notes": "Stompers are only made by Dahl and Tediore; Hyperion does not produce them. They never spawn with elemental accessories. Because the Stomper effect is tied to a title, unique, legendary, and pearlescent weapons cannot have it. Lilith's High Velocity can help compensate for the slow projectile. The Stomper title (Title_Damage2_Stomper) is given to high-damage combat rifles, greatly increases damage, and significantly reduces bullet velocity. The Cobra title prevents Stompers with accuracy above about 93% from spawning. See stat modifiers for details.",
