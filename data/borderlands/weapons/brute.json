  "description": "Brute shotguns have no special mechanics beyond exceptionally high damage. Hyperion long-barrel versions can reach unusually high accuracy for a shotgun (around 82%), and with Scattershot plus a strong Commando COM they can become effective at medium-to-long range.",
  "notes": "Maliwan does not make Brutes because the damage threshold is too high. The Brute title (Title_Damage1_Brute) is granted to assault shotguns with very high damage and pushes damage even higher; see stat modifiers for how the title changes the weapon.",
