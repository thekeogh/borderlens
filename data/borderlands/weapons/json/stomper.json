  "name": "Stomper",
  "type": "Assault Rifle",
  "description": "Stompers usually sit in the high-80s to low-90s accuracy range, but their slow bullet velocity makes them awkward at long distance. They deal very high damage per shot, and the best use is classic close-range rifle play: empty the magazine on a single target from cover, then reload.",
  "notes": "Stompers are only made by Dahl and Tediore; Hyperion does not produce them. They never spawn with elemental accessories. Because the Stomper effect is tied to a title, unique, legendary, and pearlescent weapons cannot have it. Lilith's High Velocity can help compensate for the slow projectile. The Stomper title (Title_Damage2_Stomper) is given to high-damage combat rifles, greatly increases damage, and significantly reduces bullet velocity. The Cobra title prevents Stompers with accuracy above about 93% from spawning. See stat modifiers for details.",
