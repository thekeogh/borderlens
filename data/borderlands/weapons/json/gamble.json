  "name": "Gamble",
  "type": "Sniper",
  "description": "Gamble is a pump-action sniper title that trades accuracy for big damage and stronger elemental tech. It increases critical hit damage (around +50%) but lowers accuracy, making every shot a risk: body hits are common, but headshots are devastating. Only Jakobs and Vladof manufacture Gamble rifles.",
  "notes": "The name reflects the playstyle, with high damage but unreliable precision, so critical hits are less consistent even when aiming carefully. The Gamble title (Title_LowAccuracy1_Gamble) is granted to sniper rifles with accuracy below about 94.7 and further increases inaccuracy while boosting critical damage and tech; see stat modifiers for details.",
