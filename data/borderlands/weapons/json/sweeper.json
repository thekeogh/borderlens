  "type": "Shotgun",
  "description": "Sweeper is the assault shotgun counterpart to the Matador. It trades pellet count for fire rate: fewer pellets (8 vs 12) but a faster rate of fire. The result is lower damage per shot but heavy recoil, rapid ammo burn, and short bursts between reloads.",
  "notes": "The Sweeper title (Title_HighSpread1_Sweeper) is granted to shotguns with high spread and does little more than add a single projectile. See stat modifiers for details.",
