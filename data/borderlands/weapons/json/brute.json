  "name": "Brute",
  "type": "Shotgun",
  "description": "Brute is a shotgun title built around raw damage with no special handling tricks required. Hyperion longbarrel variants can reach accuracy around 82.3%, which is unusually high for shotguns. With Scattershot at rank 5 plus a strong Commando COM, both accuracy and base damage can climb by roughly 45%, making Brutes very effective at medium to long range.",
  "notes": "Maliwan does not make Brutes because the damage threshold is too high. The Brute title (Title_Damage1_Brute) is granted to assault shotguns with very high damage and pushes damage even higher; see stat modifiers for how the title changes the weapon.",
