  "type": "Shotgun",
  "description": "Carnage shotguns fire slow, heavy rockets. Each shell launches a single rocket like a rocket launcher projectile, and shots always proc an elemental effect, defaulting to explosive. Any elemental accessory can spawn on a Carnage and will change the element, but that accessory also lowers the listed damage. Even an explicit explosive accessory mainly reduces damage compared with no accessory at all.",
  "notes": "Lilith's High Velocity skill makes Carnage rounds much more practical by reducing the slow projectile weakness, and elemental tech or class mods can turn them into brutal burst weapons. As with normal rockets, Roland's Impact skill does not affect Carnage projectiles. The Carnage effect comes from the barrel3_Carnage barrel, which grants the Title_Barrel3_Carnage title; it behaves like a standard barrel3 but with higher damage, and its reduced tech is irrelevant because the projectiles are treated as rockets. See stat modifiers for details.",
