  "description": "Hawkeye is the ultra-accurate pump-action sniper title. These rifles sit among the most precise in the game, always at or above 98% accuracy, and they are very rare. Every Hawkeye uses barrel5 (the most accurate sniper barrel), and some scopes gain a subtle +0.1x zoom without changing their appearance.",
  "notes": "Vladof cannot manufacture Hawkeyes because their material grades add spread. The Hawkeye title (Title_Accuracy1_Hawkeye) requires accuracy of at least 98.7, trims spread by about 10%, and slightly boosts zoom; very few part combinations qualify, which is why Hawkeyes are so uncommon.",
