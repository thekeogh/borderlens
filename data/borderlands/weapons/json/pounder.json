  "type": "Assault Rifle",
  "description": "Pounders are not a popular default rifle because they combine middling accuracy with low fire rate and frequent reloads. Still, they hit nearly as hard per shot as a comparable revolver, reload faster, and always come with a scope. Their slow cadence also tends to make elemental effects more frequent and potent as tech has time to recharge.",
  "notes": "The Pounder effect comes from the mag1a_pounder magazine. Non-unique and non-legendary versions also gain the Pounder title (Title_Mag1_Pounder), which adds roughly 10% damage. See stat modifiers for details.",
