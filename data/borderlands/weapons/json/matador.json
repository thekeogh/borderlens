  "type": "Shotgun",
  "description": "Matador is a shotgun title that is especially effective against Spiderants, Skags, Psychos, and zombies. Rakk can also be viable targets if you catch them clustered on approach.",
  "notes": "The Matador effect comes from the Title_HighSpread2_Matador title and is given to shotguns with accuracy below 33.3% and rarity above 6. The effect adds 3 pellets and increases fire rate by 25%. Shotguns with low accuracy but not enough rarity for Matador use the Scattergun title instead. Because the effect comes from the title, unique/legendary Matadors cannot appear. See stat modifiers for how to interpret these modifiers.",
