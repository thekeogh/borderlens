  "type": "Assault Rifle",
  "description": "Maulers are Support Machine Guns that shine in tight, cover-heavy areas like Old Haven. They can still roll decent accuracy and fire rate, but the very best guns often qualify for higher-priority titles such as Havoc or Massacre, making elite Maulers harder to find.",
  "notes": "Because Mauler is a damage-focused title, elemental Machine Guns do not spawn as Maulers. The Mauler firing sound is unique and resembles the Scorpio turret; Stompers share the same audio. The Mauler title (Title_Damage1_Mauler) grants about +15% damage.",
