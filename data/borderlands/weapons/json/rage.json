  "description": "Rage is a repeater pistol that has notable accuracy, fires in bursts.",
  "notes": "Rage is a nameplate ( Title_Firerate1_Rage ) given to machine pistols that spawn with the Rage accessory ( acc2_Rage ). The accessory itself only gives a slight tech boost (which by itself is useless as being an accessory, it prevents the weapon from being elemental); the burst fire and fire rate boost are granted by the title in its place. This means that while it's possible to find the Rage accessory on a legendary machine pistol (except the Reaper ), it is impossible to obtain a legendary machine Pistol with the Rage effect.",
