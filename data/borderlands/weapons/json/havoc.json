  "description": "Havoc is the high fire-rate Support Machine Gun title, starting at roughly 10.0 fire rate with a larger magazine. Damage and accuracy can vary widely, but the class's recoil reduction while scoped lets Havocs excel in short, brutal firefights. They work well against swarms or a single tough Badass.",
  "notes": "The Havoc title (Title_Firerate1_Havoc) is granted only to Support Machine Guns with fire rate above 10.0 and increases magazine capacity to offset the heavy ammo consumption.",
