  "description": "Thunder is a high-damage sniper rifle title that marks powerful sniper rolls. The title is cosmetic and does not change weapon behavior, but it is associated with the hardest-hitting sniper variants.",
  "notes": "Thunder is assigned to sniper rifles with high damage. Pump-action snipers use the Thunder title, while semi-automatic snipers use the Driver title instead, and the name does not affect stats.\nFrom the part naming, a separate Driver title was planned for semi-auto snipers, but those parts still show up in-game as Thunder.",
