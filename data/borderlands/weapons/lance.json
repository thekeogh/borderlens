  "description": "Lance is a Hyperion semi-auto sniper rifle title reserved for the highest-accuracy rolls. It always uses the most accurate barrel and boosts damage, knockback, and tech, resulting in extremely precise long-range rifles that are not Invaders.",
  "notes": "Only the most accurate Hyperion rifles can roll the Lance title, sometimes producing a Crimson prefix that nods to the Crimson Lance. The title (Title_Accuracy1_Lance) requires barrel5, Hyperion manufacture, and excludes the Invader; it boosts damage, knockback, and tech. See stat modifiers for details.",
